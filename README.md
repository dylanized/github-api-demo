# github-api-demo

This demo shows a simple Node.js API that queries the Github API for a given user and returns a tree of 5 followers for that user, 3 levels deep.

This demo uses Axios to query Github and JavaScript promises to manage the recursion.

To run the demo:

# optionally edit the configuration inside `config.json`
# install dependencies with `npm install`
# start the API with `npm start`
# query a user by visiting http://localhost:3000/followers/foobar where 'foobar' is the username
